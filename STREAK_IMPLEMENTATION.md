# 🔥 Streak System Implementation Guide

This document provides complete instructions for implementing the professional streak system in your StudyTimer application.

## 📋 **Implementation Overview**

The streak system has been designed with the following features:
- ✅ **5-minute minimum:** Users must study at least 5 minutes per day to maintain/start a streak
- ✅ **Daily validation:** Prevents duplicate streak increments for multiple sessions on the same day
- ✅ **Automatic streak breaking:** Streaks are broken if a user doesn't study for more than 1 day
- ✅ **Professional UI:** Clean integration into the existing Profile page with status indicators

## 🗄️ **Database Implementation**

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

Run the SQL commands in `database/streak-fix.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- The enhanced trigger function with 5-minute validation
-- (See full code in database/streak-fix.sql)
```

**Key Features of the Database Update:**
- Enhanced `update_user_stats()` function with 5-minute daily minimum validation
- Prevents duplicate streak increments on the same day
- Adds `check_streak_continuity()` function for daily maintenance
- Creates `user_streak_status` view for easy streak status checking

### Step 2: Required Database Permissions

Ensure your RLS policies allow access to the `user_stats` table and the new view:
- Users can read/update their own stats
- The view is accessible to authenticated users

## 🔧 **Backend Implementation**

### Step 3: Updated Service Layer

The `SessionService` has been enhanced with streak functionality:

**New Methods:**
- `getStreakData()` - Fetches current streak information with status
- `getUserStats()` - Gets complete user statistics including streaks
- `checkStreakContinuity()` - Manual trigger for streak validation

**Enhanced Existing Methods:**
- `addSession()` - Now automatically updates streaks after saving sessions
- Session context refreshes streak data when sessions are added

## 🎨 **Frontend Implementation**

### Step 4: Profile Page Integration

The Profile page now displays:

**Streak Cards:**
- **Current Streak** (🔥): Shows active streak with status message
- **Best Streak** (🏆): Shows user's longest streak ever

**Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Active today:** User has studied today
- 🟡 **At risk:** User studied yesterday, needs to study today
- 🔴 **Broken:** Streak was broken, encourage new start
- ⚪ **No streak:** User hasn't started a streak yet

### Step 5: Context Integration

The `SessionContext` now provides:
- `streakData` - Complete streak information
- Automatic refresh after session completion
- Real-time streak status updates

## 📊 **Streak Logic Details**

### Daily Validation Rules

1. **Same Day Sessions:** Multiple sessions on same day don't increment streak
2. **5-Minute Minimum:** Daily total must be ≥5 minutes to count toward streak
3. **Consecutive Days:** Streak continues only with consecutive daily study
4. **Streak Breaking:** More than 1 day without qualifying study breaks streak

### Streak Status Types

```typescript
type StreakStatus = 
  | 'active_today'    // Studied today, streak is active
  | 'at_risk'         // Studied yesterday, at risk of losing streak  
  | 'broken'          // Had a streak but missed a day
  | 'no_streak'       // No active streak
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### Step 1: Database Migration
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `database/streak-fix.sql`
3. Verify the new trigger and view are created

### Step 2: Code Deployment
1. Deploy the updated codebase with all the changes
2. The streak system will automatically start working for new sessions

### Step 3: Testing
1. Complete a 5+ minute study session
2. Check Profile page - should show "Current Streak: 1 🔥"
3. Study again next day to test streak continuation
4. Skip a day to test streak breaking

## 🔄 **Maintenance**

### Optional: Daily Streak Cleanup

While the system automatically handles most cases, you can set up a daily cron job to ensure streak consistency:

```javascript
// Call this daily at midnight UTC
await sessionService.checkStreakContinuity()
```

This ensures any edge cases with streaks are properly handled.

## 🎯 **User Experience**

The streak system provides clear feedback to users:

- **Motivational:** Fire emoji (🔥) for active streaks
- **Achievement:** Trophy emoji (🏆) for personal best
- **Guidance:** Clear status messages about what to do next
- **Visual:** Color-coded status (green=good, yellow=warning, red=broken)

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

```
Database Trigger → SessionService → SessionContext → Profile UI
     ↓                    ↓              ↓             ↓
Auto-calculate     Fetch streak    Real-time      Visual
streak values      data + status   updates       feedback
```

This architecture ensures:
- ✅ **Data consistency** at the database level
- ✅ **Real-time updates** through the context system  
- ✅ **Clean separation** of concerns
- ✅ **Professional UX** with proper status feedback

## 📝 **Notes**

- The system is designed to be robust and handle edge cases
- All database operations use proper error handling
- UI gracefully handles loading states and errors
- Streak calculation is server-side for security and consistency
