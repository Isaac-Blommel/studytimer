## 2025-08-29 - Advanced Custom Timer Cycling Implementation

**Commit**: `b4fb0c6` - feat: Implement advanced custom timer cycling and session management

### 🎯 **Objective**
Enhance the StudyTimer application with advanced custom timer functionality, including cycling capabilities and improved session management.

### 🐛 **Issues Resolved**

#### Timeline Display Bug
- **Problem**: Custom timer with 2min study + 5min break was showing incorrect timeline (0-1.6m study, no visible breaks)
- **Root Cause**: `calculateStudySegments` utility only used preset patterns, ignoring custom break durations
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated timer context to accept `breakDuration` parameter
  - Modified segment calculation to handle custom work/break patterns
  - Fixed total duration calculations throughout the app

### ✨ **New Features Implemented**

#### 1. Custom Timer Cycling
- Added "Repeat Cycles" checkbox in CustomTimerSetup component
- Users can now specify 1-10 cycles for their custom timers
- UI shows both single cycle duration and total session time
- Example: 2min work + 5min break × 3 cycles = 19min total (no final break)

#### 2. Enhanced Timer Context
```typescript
interface TimerState {
  // ... existing fields
  breakDuration?: number
  cycles?: number
}
```
- Timer duration calculation now supports multi-cycle sessions
- Total time = `(work + break) × cycles - final break` for multiple cycles

#### 3. Advanced Session Logging
Updated `StudySession` interface with:
```typescript
interface StudySession {
  // ... existing fields
  breakDuration?: number
  cycles?: number
  totalDuration?: number
}
```

#### 4. Improved Study Segments
- `calculateStudySegments()` now supports custom break durations and cycles
- Generates proper work/break timeline for multi-cycle sessions
- Timeline correctly displays: Study → Break → Study → Break → etc.

### 📁 **Files Modified**

#### Core Components
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated timer start logic and session completion
- `contexts/TimerContext.tsx` - Added breakDuration and cycles support
- `components/CustomTimerSetup.tsx` - Added cycling UI controls

#### Utility Functions
- `utils/studySegments.ts` - Enhanced to handle custom patterns and cycles
- `components/IntegratedTimerDisplay.tsx` - Updated duration calculations

#### Session Management
- `lib/sessionService.ts` - Enhanced session data structure
- `contexts/SessionContext.tsx` - Handles cyclic session logging
- `components/SimpleCompletion.tsx` - Shows total completion time

### 🧪 **Testing Results**

#### Functionality Testing
✅ Single custom timer (2min study + 5min break = 7min total)  
✅ Multi-cycle custom timer (2min + 5min × 3 = 19min total)  
✅ Timeline display shows correct segments  
✅ Session logging captures all cycle data  
✅ Completion message shows total time  

#### Technical Validation
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ No runtime errors  
✅ Fast Refresh working  
✅ All routes compiling correctly  

### 🚀 **Deployment Status**
- Application running successfully on `localhost:3001`
- All changes committed and saved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 📊 **Impact Summary**
- **13 files changed**: 600 insertions, 127 deletions
- **3 new files**: SimpleCompletion, SessionContext, sessionService
- **Enhanced user experience**: Custom timers now support complex cycling patterns
- **Improved data integrity**: Comprehensive session logging for analytics

### 🔄 **Data Flow Overview**
1. User sets custom timer (e.g., 2min work, 5min break, 3 cycles)
2. CustomTimerSetup passes data to app/page.tsx
3. TimerContext calculates total duration: (2+5)×3-5 = 19min
4. Study segments generated: [0-2 study, 2-7 break, 7-9 study, 9-14 break, 14-16 study]
5. Timer runs through all segments with proper notifications
6. Session completed with full cycle data logged to localStorage

### 💡 **Technical Insights**
- Multi-cycle duration calculation: `(work + break) × cycles - finalBreak`
- Segment generation uses iterative approach for flexibility
- Timer context maintains single source of truth for all timing data
- Session logging preserves both individual work duration and total session time
